                <p>By creating a WORKr account or by using any WORKr service, whether through a mobile device, mobile
                    application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of
                    Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Arbitration Procedures, Safety Tips, and Community
                    Guidelines, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms
                    disclosed to you if you purchase or have purchased additional features, products or services we
                    offer on the Service (collectively, this “Agreement”). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by
                    all of the terms of this Agreement (other than the limited one-time opt-out right for certain
                    members provided for in Section 15), you should not use the Service.</p>
                <p>We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to time. We may do this for a
                    variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or
                    changes in business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the
                    Service under Settings and also on goWORKr.com, and you should regularly check for the most recent
                    version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material
                    changes to your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes (unless we’re
                    unable to do so under applicable law) by reasonable means, which could include notification through
                    the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective,
                    then you agree to the revised Agreement. You agree that this Agreement shall supersede any prior
                    agreements (except as specifically stated herein), and shall govern your entire relationship with
                    WORKr, including but not limited to events, agreements, and conduct preceding your acceptance of
                    this Agreement.</p>
